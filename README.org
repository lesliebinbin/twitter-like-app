* A Twitter Like Rails Application
** Introduction
   - This is one of my personal ruby on rails perject
   - The purpose is to continually adding more functions to it as learning more
     cool stuff
   - A sample project already deployed to Heroku, please refer to
     [[https://leslie-twitter-like-app.herokuapp.com/][Heroku App]]

** Current Implemented Functions
   - user account registration and activated via email (AWS SES)
   - user reset password
   - user follow and unfollow other users
   - micropost content text search (by applying searchkick, elasticsearch)
   - view_component render for html and json response

** Todo Functions
   - Adding comment function to the post
   - Applying ActionText for rich text content
   - Realtime notification when a friend of the user make a new post or comment
     on the post
   - Integrate Graph Database Neo4j or Tinkerpop for further user relations and
     interactions analysis, one tiny issue comes to Neo4j is that ActiveGraph
     gem is based on neo4j-ruby-driver gem, neo4j-ruby-driver gem relies on
     libseabolt.so, which is a c++ project and requires to download and compile
     with cmake, while I can compile it on my laptop, on Heroku runtime it is a
     read-only container, neither yet figure out a way to compile it on Heroku
     container or just upload the dynamic library into it, luckily, seems like
     Heroku also support docker-compose project, will give that a try in future
